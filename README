Dependencies: NodeJS, Grunt, Bower, jQuery

OrionMVC requires a few things to work properly. First, OrionMVC requires that
NodeJS be installed. Once installed, cd to the application/assets/libaries
folder. run 'npm install -g grunt-cli' to install the Grunt Command Line Inter-
face. Once done, run 'npm install -g bower' to get bower setup. Finally, have
NodeJS fetch any dependencies via 'npm install && install bower'.

 \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------/
Traditional MVC separation of presentation from business logic. Shortens dev-
elopment time by providing tools and classes to generate webpages quickly and
easily. (Root/application/*)

Includes Twitter Bootstrap built-in to reduce CSS code, provide easy-to-use
grid and classes for responsive, mobile-first development, and JavaScript tools
to make development easier. (Root/application/assets/libraries/bootstrap)

SASS/SCSS is integrated at the heart of OrionMVC and is used to reduce coding
time, provide variable and function capabilities in styles development, and
allow for better encapsulation of classes and style rules. With Grunt, the SASS
code is compiled and minified into CSS. (Root/application/assets/scss/*)

jQuery+UI is pre-installed to speed up client-side scripting and interface dev-
elopment. (Root/public_www/assets/js)

Multilingual support is built-in at the core. Classes and sample data files are
included which show how to expand the framework to support multiple languages.
