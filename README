OrionMVC requires a few things to work properly. First, OrionMVC requires that
NodeJS be installed. Once installed, cd to the application/assets/libaries
folder. run <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code> to install the Grunt Command Line Inter-
face. Once done, run 'npm install -g bower' to get bower setup. Finally, have
NodeJS fetch any dependencies via 'npm install && install bower'.
